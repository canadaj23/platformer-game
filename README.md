# platformer-game
This is a platformer game that will evolve over time. 
This game is based off Kaarin Gaming's (see YouTube) iteration of a platformer game. There are word-for-word lines of code, but also some reworked keywords, classes, etc. 
This game is intended for people who wish to see a version of a platfomer game done completely in the Java programming language.
For me, this is not only a way for me to practice and learn Java, but also a way for me to see how game development works.
